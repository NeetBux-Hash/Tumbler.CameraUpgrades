# Camera Upgrades Mod 

## Overview:
**Camera Upgrades** is a mod designed to overhaul both the regular and suspect cameras in *Hitman WOA*, adding new features and fixes to enhance gameplay. The mod gives players more control over the camera’s behavior, adds helpful customization options, and improves usability for different playstyles.

---

## Installation Instructions:
1. **Download** the mod from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NeetBux-Hash/Tumbler.CameraUpgrades/releases/tag/0.4.2).
2. Open **Simple Mod Framework (SMF)**, and **click on add a mod**.
3. **Enable** the mod in the *Simple Mod Framework* program and click the deploy button.

## Key Considerations:
### Keyboard Layouts:
The mod includes various input settings based on **default keybinds**. Depending on your keyboard layout (QWERTY, AZERTY, Chinese, etc.), the keys for certain actions may differ. For example, options listed as **"A/Q"** refer to the key next to your **W** key, depending on whether you use QWERTY or AZERTY layouts.

Be mindful of how these differences may affect your controls. If something seems off, check your keybindings in the game settings.

## Mod Options and Features:

### General:
- **I agree!**  
   This option doesn’t affect gameplay but is a reminder to ensure you understand the mod and its input changes. Checking this box simply indicates that you’ve read everything.

- **I failed to understand**  
   If you’re confused by the mod’s options, this is a suggestion to uninstall and reinstall the mod. Do not enable options unless you're sure of their functions. This also doesn’t impact gameplay but is included for clarification.

---

### Fixes:
- **Stay low!**  
   Prevents Agent 47 from standing up when using the suspect camera. It also allows you to crouch while using the camera without affecting suspect tagging. This is particularly useful for stealthier playstyles.

- **Zoom slider on top**  
   Moves the zoom slider to the top of the photo mode menu. If you're using **Selfie Mode Mod** by Anthony Fuller, this will help you organize your menu better.

- **Proper flash in picture mode**  
   Keeps the flash from fading away fully when taking photos, improving visibility in dark environments (such as Berlin’s club).

---

### Camera Functions:
- **Instinct in Normal Camera**  
   This enables the **Instinct Mode** for the normal camera, similar to how it works in the suspect camera. You can use this to highlight suspects and points of interest while using the regular camera.

- **Disable Proximity-based Tagging**  
   Removes the distance restriction for suspect tagging, allowing you to tag suspects from any distance. This option is especially useful for long-range identification and keeps the gameplay more dynamic.

- **Reset Zoom on Exit**  
   Resets the zoom level to 1x whenever you exit the camera. This ensures you return to a default zoom level and avoid being stuck at awkward zoom levels after switching out.

- **Disable Suspect Reset Zoom**  
   Prevents the suspect camera from resetting its zoom when exiting and re-entering aiming mode. Only enable this if you want the zoom level to stay consistent between uses.

---

### Input Settings:
- **Scroll to Zoom**  
   Enables zooming via the mouse scroll wheel for both cameras. Be aware that this option will swap the up/down and left/right controls, which can affect menu navigation. The navigation keys will become **Z/W** and **X** depending on your keyboard layout.

---

### Group Selections:

#### Prime Set Button (For Suspect Tagging):
This group allows you to customize the **Prime Tag** button, which defaults to **Crouch (C)**. You can change it to a different key to prevent accidentally tagging suspects while crouching.

- **Off**  
   Keeps the default crouch key as the prime tag button (C).
  
- **Switch to A/Q**  
   Moves the prime tag function to the **Melee button** (A/Q), based on your layout. This helps separate crouch and suspect tagging functions.

- **Switch to E**  
   Moves the prime tag button to the **Use button** (E), which is closer to the suspect tag key for easier access.

#### Viewfinder/Hide Menu Button (Toggle):
This group allows you to adjust the buttons used for toggling the viewfinder in photo mode. The default buttons are **A/Q** for the normal camera and **E** for the suspect camera.

- **Off**  
   Keeps the default settings.
  
- **Normal camera to E**  
   Sets the **Hide Menu** button for the normal camera to **E**, matching the suspect camera.

- **Suspect camera to A/Q**  
   Sets the **Viewfinder Toggle** button for the suspect camera to **A/Q**, matching the normal camera.

---

### Zoom Options for the Suspect Camera:
These options control how the suspect camera zoom behaves.

- **Doesn’t touch any zoom options**  
   Leaves the suspect camera zoom untouched.
  
- **Increment Steps Zoom Fix**  
   Fixes the suspect camera zoom increments, allowing it to zoom in 1x steps instead of jumping straight from 1x to 4x.

- **10x Zoom with 1x Increment Steps**  
   Extends the zoom to 10x and allows zooming in 1x increments. This is the recommended option for players who want greater zoom control.

- **10x Zoom but in 2x Increments**  
   Allows 10x zoom but with larger 2x increments (2x, 4x, 6x, etc.). This can be faster but lacks a default 1x option at the moment.

---

### Editing Options:
- **Suspect Camera Filters**  
   Adds the filter options from the normal camera to the suspect camera, allowing you to apply visual effects while using it.

- **Suspect Camera DOF (Depth of Field)**  
   Adds a DOF slider to the suspect camera, giving you more control over focus.

- **Remove Normal Camera Filters/DOF**  
   Removes the filters or DOF sliders from the normal camera if you don't want them.

---

### UI Enhancements:
- **Disable Cripple Camera HUD**  
   Removes the large “USE CAMERA” button from the HUD when holding the camera. This declutters the interface, making it less intrusive and distracting.

- **Clutter Off**  
   Allows you to toggle the camera UI off while not in picture mode for a clear view.

- **Clear the Grid**  
   Removes gridlines from the suspect camera to improve visibility and make the scene less obstructed.

- **Self Cleaning UI**  
   Dynamically hides UI elements like zoom or DOF controls when they are unavailable, keeping the interface clean.
